## Who I Am

I'm Emerson Bossi, a bilingual (PT-BR/EN) technical writer and IT professional with a love for turning complex subjects into clear, accessible information. I have over 11 years of combined experience across IT, technical support, content creation, and AI training on top of my 3 years of Computer Science.

## What I Do Best

**Information Architecture:** Every documentation or project I create is focused on readability and scanability with a clear information hierarchy. This allows readers to find what they want faster.

**Technical Clarity:** While using technical terminology is great to look smart, it has its time and place. I follow style guides focused on accessibility like Google's or Microsoft's to make my content understandable for everyone.

**Docs-as-code:** I'm really comfortable working with documentation through Git workflows, versioning, and Markdown formatting an structuring.

## My Career Path 

I first started working in customer support. Then I transitioned into IT and Tech Support along with my Computer Science education. This mix of experiences helped me develop strong technical skills, like Root Cause Analysis, that allowed me to solve complex issues for end-users.

Naturally, I started documenting my problem-solving process, which led to my technical writing career by writing Standard Operating Procedures and technical documentation. So I started seeking jobs focused on writing, where I eventually started creating blog posts and articles, as well as technical documentation professionally.

Along the way, the AI boom happened with LLMs becoming extremely popular. I shifted my focus into AI for a moment, working with Prompt Engineering and Red Teaming, bringing my technical writing skills to the table to create prompts for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and safety alignment.

Currently, I still work as a content writer. However, my focus has fully shifted back to IT and technical writing, as I aim to improve my skills in this field.

To showcase all of my work, I’ve built two portfolios. My Docusaurus one, focused solely on technical writing and documentation following the Docs-as-Code workflow, and my Wix one, which is the heart of the operation and my main hub for SEO, L10n, fictional writing, and personal projects.
