My approach to documentation is different from the other content creation methods I use for SEO content writing or fictional writing.

I focus on awareness, clarity, structure, scope, and adequately aligning language to the target audience. The target is solving the problem for the reader rather than engaging them.

## My Workflow

This entire portfolio is a live proof-of-concept of my documentation methodology. It was engineered to solve a structural problem and to maximize professional transparency.

I followed this workflow to build this portfolio:

Gap Identification → Solution Research → Strategic Roadmap → Constraints & Scope Definition → Decision Making → Execution → Meta-Documentation for the Case Study

**Gap Identification:** My Wix portfolio wasn't good enough for docs-as-code documentation using Markdown. It also got lost among my other content.

**Solution Research:** I looked for a new portfolio platform so my technical documentation could stand on its own.

**Strategic Roadmap:** The point at which I decided all of the things I would want from this new project and how I would approach the execution.

**Constraints & Scope Definition:** All of the limitations I added to make the roadmap achievable within a limited timeframe.

**Decision Making:** When I finally locked in what would stay and go from my roadmap based on the constraints and scope. And also picking between which platforms to focus on and why.

**Execution:** Putting the plan to action by creating and publishing the new portfolio.

**Meta-Documentation for the Case Study:** The documentation process that ran from the start of the project so I could create a case study about the entire process and thought process.

## Sneak Peek

I'll quickly summarize some decisions here about the portfolio.

### Why Docusaurus?

Docusaurus is already the main choice of many for technical documentation due to its features. On top of that, it uses React, which I'm familiar with.

I compared it against Jekyll and Hugo, but since they use a language I'm unfamiliar with, it would require extra time and setup to get the project online.

### Why does GitHub API doc expands by default?

This was a DX decision focused on facilitating navigation.

This documentation was built with modularity for scalability. So there are multiple global guides, then a reference folder with the endpoints folder within. Meaning that there are a lot of suborders to click before you can get where you want.

So instead of making readers click through a lot of folders, I decided to have it expanded and set it as the featured in the sidebar to highlight it.

### Why did you pick these samples?

The current list of samples is short and objective. They were projects I had already written, and some even published.

So converting them to Markdown using docs-as-code was faster than creating documentation from scratch.

They serve as short, but effective examples, covering a different range of skills each with little overlap.

The samples will be expanded with both more quality and quantity. However, adding them as is was a conscious choice to keep within time constraints with a good balance of quality and quantity.
